## Data Description

The raw motion data is in single .csv format.

The raw motion data are of 120 features.
The 120 features are generated by 6 channels x 20 time points.

- The 6 channels are position difference on 3 axes dx, dy, dx and 3 angle difference rotating with the 3 axes;
- The 20 time points are linear separated by 200 ms for each two time points.

The raw motion data has thousands of samples.
The samples are labeled as 9 motion events.

- 1-SLW: Slow-speed Level Walking;
- 2-MLW: Medium-speed Level Walking;
- 3-FLW: Fast-speed Level Walking;
- 4-RD: Ramp Descending;
- 5-SD: Stair Descending;
- 6-sit: Sitting Down;
- 7-stand: Standing Up;
- 8-RA: Ramp Ascending;
- 9-SA: Stair Ascending.

## Analysis

The script will **Parse** the raw motion data and **Visualize** it in 2D space.

### Parse

The raw motion will be read and the data of different motion events will be separated.
The separated motion data will be transformed from
the shape of (s x 120) to the shape of (s x 20 x 6),
where the 20 refers the 20 time points and the 6 refers the 6 channels.
The parsed data will be saved into the separated .npy file named as their events,
like 1-SLM.npy.

### Visualize

To generate the visualization of the relationship between the motion events.
The TSNE bedding method is usd to project the 120 features data into 2D manifold spaces.
The projected samples will be drawn into the 2D space.

Since there are too many samples, it is impossible to draw all of them.
In practice, the data are randomized averaged to formulate less samples to be drawn.
The projected 2D features and the plot will be saved when the script is operated.

- The 2D features data will be saved as "TSNE Plot.csv";
- The Plot will be saved as "TSNE Plot.html".
